# About
This is a repository for a *Luxor* to *OpenSMCE* converter.

This is needed so that the engine can be legally playtested (*Luxor* assets can't be uploaded on the repository).

# Todo
- *Luxor: Amun Rising* support
- Support for the most of *Luxor* and *Luxor: Amun Rising* mods

The main OpenSMCE project can be found at https://github.com/jakubg1/OpenSMCE
